# <center> Boolean Algebra</center>

 - Boolean Algebra was invented by George Boole in 1854.
 - It only uses binary numbers 0 and 1, which indicates low and high respectively.
 - Used to analyze and simplify Digital or Logic circuit.
 - Also known as Binary Algebra or Logical Algebra.
 - It is mathematics of digital logic. 

## Basic Operations
Boolean Expression:
: Boolean Expression is a combination of Boolean operators, constants and variables. <br>
example: `A + B`

Boolean Operator:
: Boolean Operators are operators which indicates use of some logical operation such as `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` etc.

Boolean Constants:
: Boolean Constants are values which would not change. Only two constants are present in Boolean Algebra that are 0 and 1.

Boolean Variable:
: A variable acts as a placeholder for values which may change in a given time. Boolean Variable can only store either of the value 0 or 1. <br>
example:  
`A=0`, `B=1`; putting that values in expression `A+B` would result in 1 by applying OR logic.

Some common boolean operator are:
 - OR/+: This operation tells "
